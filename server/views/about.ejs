        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Southern Love Kitchen</strong> was born from a passion for soulful flavors, family tradition, and sharing good food with good people.<br><br>
          Chef Meechii started in a small kitchen, guided by family recipes and fueled by a dream: to bring the warmth and joy of authentic southern cooking to the community.<br><br>
          Every dish is made with love, patience, and pride—from perfectly crispy fried chicken to melt-in-your-mouth peach cobbler. Our mission is to serve every guest like family and deliver southern hospitality with every bite.
        </p>
